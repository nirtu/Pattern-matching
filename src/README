Submitted files:
	list.c - creates a list
	pattern_matching.c - implements 
	README - this file
Remarks:
	pattern matching must be called with an array and not with a linked list.
	the list supported action were given in slist.h - NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE .h FILE.
	the pattern matcher build according to a given H file and algorithem - NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE .h FILE.
	My implementation allows to create a linked List of data (from different types - user responsibility to identify the type).
	the documentation were made in the files but since you gave us the .h file with documentation i did a little of that.
	in case my program is failing it returns only -1 (in fatal error exit(-1)) but I have no message to the stderr that because there where instruction 			for that!!!
